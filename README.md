# nipkow-disk-generator
tl;dr: Some very old code I wrote that generates Nipkow disks as PDFs

Nearly 20 years ago I wanted to make a Baird mechanical TV system using Panasonic 2x CD-ROM drives that had DC motors. Thus I wrote this code to generate Nipkow disk templates. In the end I never got beyond making a Nipkow disk, and the rest is lost to time.

This was written in PHP 4, using the now long ago deprecated PDF library. Thus it won't work on any remotely recent PHP versions. It's legacy code presented here for interest only, should you wish to write your own Nipkow generator using its trigonometry. I will not develop it any further, it's an ancient project, you're on your own.

The PDF is a template for a standard CD-ROM. Print, stick, and drill.
